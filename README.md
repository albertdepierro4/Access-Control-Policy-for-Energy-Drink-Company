# Access-Control-Policy-for-Energy-Drink-Company
This project demonstrates my ability to design an access control policy as part of Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC). It outlines authentication methods, RBAC, access provisioning/deprovisioning, and monitoring, all tied to protecting sensitive company information.

Perfect ‚Äî let‚Äôs reframe it into something that looks polished and professional for GitHub. Here‚Äôs a full **README.md draft** you can copy and paste into your repo:

# Access Control Policy ‚Äì Energy Drink Company (SLIME)

## üìå Overview

This project demonstrates my ability to design and document an **Access Control Policy**, a core part of **Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC)** in cybersecurity. The policy was created for a mock company, *Albert‚Äôs Energy Drink Company (SLIME)*, and outlines controls to protect proprietary information, such as the company‚Äôs ‚Äúsecret formula.‚Äù

The goal is to show how GRC principles translate into clear, enforceable policies that align with business objectives and security best practices.

## üõ°Ô∏è Key Policy Components

* **Password Policy**

  * Minimum 10 characters, including numbers and special symbols (`@ $ % #`).
  * Regular password updates required.
  * Password sharing strictly prohibited.

* **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**

  * Required for accessing sensitive systems and data.
  * Adds a second layer of defense beyond passwords.

* **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**

  * Access is granted based on job role and responsibilities.
  * Supports the principle of least privilege.
  * Access rights reviewed periodically for accuracy.

* **Access Provisioning & Deprovisioning**

  * Employees must submit formal requests with justification.
  * Department managers/IT admins review requests.
  * Access revoked immediately when no longer needed.

* **Logging & Monitoring**

  * All login attempts are logged.
  * Sensitive data access is audited.
  * Alerts for suspicious or unauthorized activity.

## üéØ GRC Relevance

This project ties directly to governance and compliance frameworks:

* **NIST 800-53**: Access Control (AC) Family.
* **ISO/IEC 27001**: Annex A.9 (Access Control).
* **General GRC Principle**: Aligning security policies with business needs.

By defining authentication requirements, RBAC models, and monitoring processes, this project demonstrates how strong access control reduces risk and strengthens compliance posture.

## üß† Challenges & Lessons Learned

* Translating technical concepts (RBAC, MFA) into policy language for non-technical stakeholders.
* Understanding how access requests and revocations must be formally documented.
* Recognizing the critical role of logging for both **security monitoring** and **audit compliance**.
